# Installing the `uv` Requirement for `/deerflow` on Fedora

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) in the `/deerflow` directory.

## 1. Install Python (if not already installed)

```sh
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
```

## 2. Install `uv`

`uv` is a fast Python package installer and resolver. You can install it with pipx (recommended) or pip:

### Option 1: Install with pipx (recommended)

If you don't have pipx:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Then install uv:

```sh
pipx install uv
```

### Option 2: Install with pip

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user uv
```

## 3. Navigate to the `/deerflow` Directory

```sh
cd /path/to/Team-A1/deer-flow
```

> ðŸ’¡ Replace `/path/to/Team-A1` with the path to your cloned repository.

## 4. Install Project Dependencies with `uv`

If the project uses a `requirements.txt`:

```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if the project uses `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

## 5. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

Youâ€™re now ready to use the dependencies managed by uv for the `/deerflow` folder!
```

If you have a specific requirements file or need further guidance (e.g., for `pyproject.toml`), let me know!
